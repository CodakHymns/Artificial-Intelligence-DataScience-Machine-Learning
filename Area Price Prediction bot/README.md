This Python code is performing a simple linear regression analysis on a dataset. 
Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

-It imports the necessary libraries: pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib.pyplot for data visualization, and sklearn.linear_model for the linear regression model.
-It loads a dataset from a CSV file named ‘dataset.csv’ into a pandas DataFrame.
-It creates a scatter plot of ‘area’ against ‘prices’ from the DataFrame.
-It creates a Linear Regression model using the ‘sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression’ class.
-It fits the model to the data, using ‘prices’ as the target variable and all other columns as the predictors.
-It prints the coefficients and the intercept of the fitted model.
-It uses the model to predict the prices for areas of 1200, 9000, and 11000.
To run this code, you need to have the following Python packages installed:
--pandas
--matplotlib
--scikit-learn

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python packages:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

Please replace 'pip' with 'pip3' or the appropriate command for your Python environment if necessary. Also, it's a good practice to use a virtual environment for your Python projects to avoid conflicts between package versions. You can use tools like `venv` or `conda` to manage virtual environments.
